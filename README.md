## Project Version2

* This is a simple scalable distributed file system bulit on Raft.
* MapReduce framework for words count was build on top of the file system.

## Raft Algorithm Supports

* Leader Election
* Log Replication
* Log Persistency.
* Log Snapshotting.


## Commands to run the project

* `run_Raft.py`, At the root `system-version-2` for raft algorithm test
* `run_partA.py`, At the root `system-version-2` for sequential mapreduce
* `run_partB.py`, At the root `system-version-2` for distributed mapreduce
